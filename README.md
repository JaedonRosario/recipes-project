# Recipes Project
This is the first project in my goal of learning html, CSS, and javascript.

With this project I will be demonstrating the following skills:

    Creating html files with correct boilerplates.

    Utilizing html elements such as headers, paragraphs, bold text, italicized text, images, lists, and links.

    Using git and github to add, commit, and push files to my repository, as well as using good commit message practices to make detailed yet concise comments.
